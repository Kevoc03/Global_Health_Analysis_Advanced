# Disease Mortality Rate Prediction

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict disease mortality rates based on a dataset with features like disease category, health infrastructure index, GDP, vaccination availability, and population density.

## 🔍 Overview

We used a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the mortality rate of various diseases. Data preprocessing, label encoding, model training, prediction, evaluation (MSE, R²), and visualization were conducted.

## 📦 Dataset Features

- Disease Category
- Health Infrastructure Index
- GDP per Capita
- Availability of Vaccines/Treatment
- Population Density
- Mortality Rate (%) (Target)

## 📈 Model Performance

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
- Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted mortality rates

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook on Kaggle.
2. Run each cell step-by-step.
3. View the performance metrics and visualization.
